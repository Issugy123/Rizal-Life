                    <p id="Summary" style="border: rgb(255, 255, 255) solid 2px; padding: 50px; margin: 50px; visibility: hidden;;">
                        
                        <br>The 19th century was a crucial period in Philippine history, bringing major political, economic, social, and cultural changes. Under Spanish colonial rule, the Philippines was governed by the Governor-General, who represented the Spanish Crown. However, the colonial government was highly corrupt, with excessive taxation and widespread abuses by Spanish officials and friars. Liberal ideas from Europe, particularly from the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, influenced José Rizal and other Filipino intellectuals, shaping their desire for reform and justice.
    
                        <br>Economically, Spain’s decision to open Manila to world trade in 1834 led to significant changes. A new middle class, the ilustrados, emerged, including Rizal’s family. While this boosted economic activity through cash crops like sugar, tobacco, and abaca, it also worsened economic inequality. Spanish elites and friars controlled vast lands (haciendas), forcing Filipino farmers into unfair labor systems such as polo y servicios (forced labor). This growing economic disparity fueled resentment among Filipinos.
                        
                        <br>Education and social structure also played a role in the awakening of Filipino nationalism. The ilustrados studied in Europe and returned with progressive ideas, advocating for reforms. However, the education system remained under the control of Spanish friars, limiting access to knowledge for most Filipinos. The Gomburza execution in 1872 further ignited resistance, as Filipino priests like Father José Burgos fought for equal treatment in the church. Rizal, influenced by these events, strongly supported education and empowerment, including advocating for women’s rights, as seen in his letter to the women of Malolos.
                        
                        <br>This topic was chosen by this  because it provides a clear understanding of the historical events that shaped Rizal’s thoughts and actions. It highlights how various political, economic, and social issues fueled Filipino nationalism and led to the eventual fight for independence. Learning about Rizal in the context of the 19th century helps in appreciating his role not just as a writer but as a key figure in the country’s fight against colonial oppression. His story remains relevant today, reminding Filipinos of the importance of education, critical thinking, and standing up against injustices.

<h1 style="margin:10px 100px ;margin-top: 100px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 100px bold;" > 1. The filmmakers discuss their intent to create a film about José Rizal. What challenges do they
    anticipate in portraying his life?</h1>
    
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">

        <img src="assets/Conchas/C1.jfif" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The filmmakers struggle with how to portray Rizal’s heroism in a way that is both historically accurate and compelling for audiences. They question whether he truly deserves the title of National Hero, considering his refusal to fully support the revolution. The film also highlights the difficulty of distinguishing between the facts and myths surrounding his life. Additionally, they express frustration over the lack of definitive evidence regarding key moments in Rizal’s story, such as his alleged retraction and his relationships. They even compare their filmmaking process to a detective investigation, as they sift through conflicting accounts and historical gaps (00:06 - 03:24).
</p>

<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" > 2. A debate arises about the authenticity of Rizal&#39;s retraction document. What are the main
    arguments presented regarding its validity?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C2.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>Pro-Retraction: The Catholic Church claims Rizal recanted his anti-Catholic writings and returned to the faith before his execution. Church officials point to a supposed document signed by Rizal on December 29, 1896, which states he retracts his Masonic beliefs and acknowledges the authority of the Church.
    <br>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>Anti-Retraction: Rizal’s family and many historians argue the document is a forgery, as the signature appears inconsistent with his other writings. Moreover, the original document was allegedly lost and only resurfaced decades later under suspicious circumstances.
    <br>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The filmmakers examine the inconsistencies in the retraction’s text and signature, questioning whether it was fabricated to reclaim Rizal as a Catholic hero. Despite investigating multiple sources, they struggle to reach a conclusive answer, reinforcing the controversy’s dead-end nature (06:32 - 07:30, 44:26 - 45:40).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  3. The character of Josephine Bracken is introduced. How does the film depict her relationship with
    Rizal?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C3.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The film presents Josephine Bracken as a sentimental but controversial figure in Rizal’s life. Based on her letters, she appears deeply in love with Rizal, often writing emotionally charged messages about their relationship. However, Rizal’s family is skeptical of her and questions her influence on him.

    <br><br> <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>There are also doubts about whether they were legally married. Rizal attempted to wed Josephine in a Catholic ceremony, but the Church required him to sign a retraction first, which he reportedly refused. Some accounts suggest they had an informal marriage, while others argue they simply lived together. Additionally, the film references rumors that Josephine gave birth to a child who later died, but historical evidence on this remains inconclusive. The film also explores Josephine’s background, suggesting she was a dancer in a Hong Kong club before meeting Rizal. Some characters dismiss her as an opportunist, while others portray her as a devoted partner who stood by Rizal until his final moments (16:03 - 19:48, 34:41 - 37:39).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  4. The filmmakers interview a historian about Rizal&#39;s alleged retraction. What evidence is provided
    to support or refute the claim?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C4.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">======-----------</span>A historian presents various pieces of evidence regarding the retraction controversy:
    <br><br>

    1. Church archives claim to hold the original document, but it was supposedly lost for decades before being “rediscovered.”
    <br>2. Rizal’s family insists they never saw any such document, and his sister, Trinidad Rizal, publicly denied its authenticity.
    <br>3. A conflicting account from 1949 suggests that Trinidad later changed her stance and acknowledged Rizal’s return to Catholicism, but this is disputed.
    <br><br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The historian argues that the Church had a vested interest in proving Rizal’s retraction, as it would reclaim him as a faithful Catholic rather than an enemy of the institution. However, the film suggests that without the original document or Rizal’s explicit public declaration, the question remains unresolved  (55:54 - 59:01, 01:02:18 - 01:06:19).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 10px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  5. The film presents different portrayals of Rizal’s execution. How does each version differ, and what
    do these differences suggest?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C5.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-0-0-0----======-----------</span>
    The film presents multiple interpretations of Rizal’s execution:
    <br><br>
    1.The Official Narrative: Rizal bravely faces the firing squad, maintaining his dignity as a martyr for <br>the Filipino people.
    <br>2.Religious Perspective: Some accounts suggest Rizal received Catholic rites before his death, portraying him as a Christian hero.
    <br>3.Political Manipulation: The filmmakers question whether Rizal’s execution was used as propaganda by both the Spanish and later the Filipino revolutionaries.
    <br><br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>
    These variations highlight how history is shaped by those who write it, and the film critiques the romanticized version of Rizal’s death while emphasizing its symbolic power (04:51 - 06:32, 01:04:12 - 01:06:19).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  6. One of the characters questions whether Rizal was truly a hero. What reasoning do they give to
    challenge his heroism?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C6.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing The film explores doubts about Rizal’s heroism by examining his stance on the revolution. Some characters argue that Rizal did not fully support the revolution and even distanced himself from it, preferring reforms through peaceful means. They question whether a hero can be someone who refused to fight.
    <br><br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>However, others counter that Rizal’s writings inspired the revolution, making him an intellectual force behind the struggle for independence. The film ultimately leaves the question open-ended, forcing viewers to reconsider what makes a true hero (13:02 - 14:03, 01:03:15 - 01:04:12).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  7. A scene features a discussion about Rizal’s religious beliefs. How does the film depict his stance
    on faith and the Catholic Church?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C7.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span> Rizal’s letters reveal his deep skepticism toward the Catholic Church, which he viewed as corrupt and oppressive. His writings criticize religious hypocrisy and challenge traditional doctrines.
    <br><br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>His family, particularly his mother, feared that Rizal had lost faith. However, the film suggests he maintained a personal spirituality, even if he rejected institutionalized religion. The conflicting accounts of his final moments further complicate the issue—did he return to Catholicism, or was the retraction forced upon him posthumously? (20:59 - 23:23, 55:54 - 59:01).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  8. The film uses a unique narrative style, including fictionalized conversations with Rizal. How does
    this technique affect storytelling?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C8.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The filmmakers use a unique narrative technique where they “interview” Rizal as if he were alive. This allows them to directly challenge him on key controversies, such as the retraction and his stance on the revolution.

    This technique makes Rizal’s story feel more personal and engaging, allowing audiences to hear different perspectives directly from the historical figure himself. It also emphasizes the filmmakers’ struggle to find definitive answers, reinforcing the idea that history is often subjective  (01:25:12 - 01:28:43).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  9. At one point, the filmmakers express frustration with their research on Rizal. What specific issue
    causes this frustration?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C9.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The filmmakers become frustrated by the numerous contradictions in Rizal’s story. They find that key documents are missing, unreliable, or disputed.

    The retraction controversy, in particular, is a source of frustration, as there is no definitive proof either way. They question whether their film can ever uncover the truth, or if they are merely adding to the speculation (14:03 - 16:03, 45:40 - 47:08).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  10. The film concludes with a reflection on Rizal&#39;s legacy. How do the filmmakers interpret his impact
    on contemporary Philippine society?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/Conchas/C10.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The film concludes that Rizal remains a complex figure whose legacy is interpreted in different ways. Some see him as a symbol of intellectual resistance, while others question his reluctance to support the revolution.
    <br><br>
    Ultimately, the filmmakers acknowledge that Rizal’s story is full of ambiguities, but his impact on Philippine history is undeniable. Whether or not he retracted, whether or not he fully supported the revolution, his writings and ideas continue to shape the nation (01:26:31 - 01:30:46).
