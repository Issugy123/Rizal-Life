<h1 style="text-align: center; margin: 50px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 150px bold;" id="B3W"> Summary of Bayaning 3rd World </h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The movie Bayaning 3rd World explores the life of José Rizal and the controversies surrounding his final days. It focuses on the question of whether Rizal retracted his criticisms of the Catholic Church before his execution. The film follows two filmmakers investigating this issue, but they encounter different perspectives and conflicting historical records. Some sources claim that Rizal signed a retraction document, while others argue that it was forged or manipulated.
    <br><br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>One of the main ideas presented in the film is the complexity of history and the difficulty of determining the absolute truth. Many historical events are based on different interpretations, and the lack of solid evidence makes it challenging to confirm what really happened. The movie highlights how Rizal is seen as a national hero, but at the same time, he was a human being who faced personal struggles and dilemmas. His decisions were influenced by the political and religious pressures of his time.
    <br><br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The film also emphasizes the role of colonialism and religion in shaping Philippine history. During the Spanish colonization, the Catholic Church and the Spanish government had significant power and control over people’s beliefs and actions. This influence affected how Rizal’s story was recorded and remembered. The movie suggests that history is often written by those in power, which raises questions about the accuracy of historical accounts.
    <br><br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span> In the end, the film does not provide a clear answer regarding Rizal’s retraction. Instead, it challenges the audience to think critically about history and question the sources of information. It portrays Rizal not just as a hero but as a person with struggles and uncertainties. By presenting multiple perspectives, the film encourages viewers to analyze historical events with a more open and questioning mindset.

                    <br>The 19th century was a crucial period in Philippine history, bringing major political, economic, social, and cultural changes. Under Spanish colonial rule, the Philippines was governed by the Governor-General, who represented the Spanish Crown. However, the colonial government was highly corrupt, with excessive taxation and widespread abuses by Spanish officials and friars. Liberal ideas from Europe, particularly from the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, influenced José Rizal and other Filipino intellectuals, shaping their desire for reform and justice.

                    <br>Economically, Spain’s decision to open Manila to world trade in 1834 led to significant changes. A new middle class, the ilustrados, emerged, including Rizal’s family. While this boosted economic activity through cash crops like sugar, tobacco, and abaca, it also worsened economic inequality. Spanish elites and friars controlled vast lands (haciendas), forcing Filipino farmers into unfair labor systems such as polo y servicios (forced labor). This growing economic disparity fueled resentment among Filipinos.
                    
                    <br>Education and social structure also played a role in the awakening of Filipino nationalism. The ilustrados studied in Europe and returned with progressive ideas, advocating for reforms. However, the education system remained under the control of Spanish friars, limiting access to knowledge for most Filipinos. The Gomburza execution in 1872 further ignited resistance, as Filipino priests like Father José Burgos fought for equal treatment in the church. Rizal, influenced by these events, strongly supported education and empowerment, including advocating for women’s rights, as seen in his letter to the women of Malolos.
                    
                    <br>This topic was chosen by this  because it provides a clear understanding of the historical events that shaped Rizal’s thoughts and actions. It highlights how various political, economic, and social issues fueled Filipino nationalism and led to the eventual fight for independence. Learning about Rizal in the context of the 19th century helps in appreciating his role not just as a writer but as a key figure in the country’s fight against colonial oppression. His story remains relevant today, reminding Filipinos of the importance of education, critical thinking, and standing up against injustices.
