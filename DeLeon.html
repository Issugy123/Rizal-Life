                <p id="Summary" style="border: rgb(255, 255, 255) solid 2px; padding: 50px; margin: 50px; visibility: hidden;;">
                    
                    <br>The 19th century was a crucial period in Philippine history, bringing major political, economic, social, and cultural changes. Under Spanish colonial rule, the Philippines was governed by the Governor-General, who represented the Spanish Crown. However, the colonial government was highly corrupt, with excessive taxation and widespread abuses by Spanish officials and friars. Liberal ideas from Europe, particularly from the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, influenced José Rizal and other Filipino intellectuals, shaping their desire for reform and justice.

                    <br>Economically, Spain’s decision to open Manila to world trade in 1834 led to significant changes. A new middle class, the ilustrados, emerged, including Rizal’s family. While this boosted economic activity through cash crops like sugar, tobacco, and abaca, it also worsened economic inequality. Spanish elites and friars controlled vast lands (haciendas), forcing Filipino farmers into unfair labor systems such as polo y servicios (forced labor). This growing economic disparity fueled resentment among Filipinos.
                    
                    <br>Education and social structure also played a role in the awakening of Filipino nationalism. The ilustrados studied in Europe and returned with progressive ideas, advocating for reforms. However, the education system remained under the control of Spanish friars, limiting access to knowledge for most Filipinos. The Gomburza execution in 1872 further ignited resistance, as Filipino priests like Father José Burgos fought for equal treatment in the church. Rizal, influenced by these events, strongly supported education and empowerment, including advocating for women’s rights, as seen in his letter to the women of Malolos.
                    
                    <br>This topic was chosen by this  because it provides a clear understanding of the historical events that shaped Rizal’s thoughts and actions. It highlights how various political, economic, and social issues fueled Filipino nationalism and led to the eventual fight for independence. Learning about Rizal in the context of the 19th century helps in appreciating his role not just as a writer but as a key figure in the country’s fight against colonial oppression. His story remains relevant today, reminding Filipinos of the importance of education, critical thinking, and standing up against injustices.

<h1 style="margin:10px 100px ;margin-top: 100px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 100px bold;" > 1. The filmmakers discuss their intent to create a film about José Rizal. What challenges do they
    anticipate in portraying his life?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D1.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The filmmakers express concern about the multiple, often conflicting narratives surrounding Rizal’s life. They struggle with balancing historical accuracy with the need to create a compelling story for modern audiences. They recognize that Rizal has become a Philippines National Hero, making it difficult to portray him as a real, flawed human being rather than a sanitized national hero. They also anticipate challenges in interpreting the controversy around his retraction, which complicates how Rizal should be remembered — as a hero, a revolutionary, or a loyal Catholic. Whereas, the movie questioned Rizal's Life if it is really like a Film or Pampelikula<br><br>
    (Timestamp: around 07:45-9:28)

<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" > 2. A debate arises about the authenticity of Rizal&#39;s retraction document. What are the main
    arguments presented regarding its validity?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D2.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br>
    <span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The film presents two sides regarding Rizal’s alleged retraction: those who believe it is authentic, citing Church records and priest testimonies, and those who question its validity, pointing out the absence of the original document and Rizal’s consistent anti-clerical views, and saying that the signed documents was forged which make a sudden return to the Church unlikely.<br><BR>
    (Timestamp: around 57:00 - 1:00:00)
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  3. The character of Josephine Bracken is introduced. How does the film depict her relationship with
    Rizal?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D3.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The film portrays Josephine Bracken as Rizal’s romantic partner and common-law wife, showing a deep emotional connection between them despite the challenges they faced. The film highlights her loyalty, standing by Rizal even during his exile in Dapitan, and suggests that their relationship was both tender and tragic, married by the pressures of his political activities and eventual execution.(Timestamp: around  15:22 - 16:37 AND 21:00-24:28) 
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  4. The filmmakers interview a historian about Rizal&#39;s alleged retraction. What evidence is provided
    to support or refute the claim?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D4.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The historian outlines the lack of a verifiable original document, pointing out that the Church’s version only appeared years after Rizal’s death. They also cite Rizal’s consistent writings criticizing the friars and their abuses, which make a last-minute retraction seem out of character. Some historians also mention the political motive for fabricating a retraction, as it would undermine Rizal’s revolutionary image. However, church records and testimonies from priests claim Rizal repented and married Josephine in the eyes of the Church, making the truth uncertain.(Timestamp: around  58:06 - 59:35  )
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 10px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  5. The film presents different portrayals of Rizal’s execution. How does each version differ, and what
    do these differences suggest?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D5.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The film shows different versions of Rizal’s execution — one where he faces the firing squad calmly, and another where he turns to face the sky in defiance, showing how his final moments have been mythologized to reflect either submission or resistance, shaping how we remember him. (Timestamp: around   48:55 - 55:33 )
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  6. One of the characters questions whether Rizal was truly a hero. What reasoning do they give to
    challenge his heroism?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D6.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>A character questions Rizal’s heroism by pointing out that he was not a soldier nor a revolutionary leader on the battlefield, unlike other figures like Bonifacio. They argue that Rizal’s elite upbringing and education in Europe made him disconnected from the true suffering of the masses. There is also speculation that Rizal’s willingness to compromise or seek reform rather than outright revolution raises doubts about his commitment to Philippine independence.(Timestamp: around   55:50 - 56:30 )
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  7. A scene features a discussion about Rizal’s religious beliefs. How does the film depict his stance
    on faith and the Catholic Church?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D7.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The film portrays Rizal as a man who critically examined religious beliefs rather than outright rejecting faith. His writings, especially Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, expose the corruption within the Spanish friars, leading many to believe he was anti-Catholic.

    <br><br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>However, the film also explores how Rizal’s mother, Teodora Alonso, remained deeply religious and feared that her son had turned away from God. One character suggests that Rizal, despite his criticisms of the clergy, still believed in a higher power.
    
    <br><br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>As the retraction controversy is discussed, the film presents conflicting views: did Rizal genuinely return to the Catholic faith, or was the document forged to portray him as a repentant son of the Church? The filmmakers leave this question open-ended, highlighting how history can be shaped by those in power (20:59 - 23:23, 55:54 - 59:01).

</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  8. The film uses a unique narrative style, including fictionalized conversations with Rizal. How does
    this technique affect storytelling?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D8.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>A unique element of the film is its use of fictionalized conversations where the filmmakers “speak” with Rizal as though he were alive. This technique allows them to challenge him directly about his choices, including his reluctance to support the revolution and the retraction controversy.

    <br><br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>hrough these imagined dialogues, the film humanizes Rizal, presenting him not as an unreachable historical figure but as someone who struggled with complex decisions. The conversations also emphasize how the filmmakers, and by extension, the audience, must decide for themselves what to believe about Rizal’s life and legacy (01:25:12 - 01:28:43).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  9. At one point, the filmmakers express frustration with their research on Rizal. What specific issue
    causes this frustration?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D9.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The filmmakers express deep frustration over the inconsistencies and contradictions in historical accounts of Rizal’s life. The retraction controversy, in particular, is a major source of aggravation, as there is no definitive proof either way.

    <br><br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>Additionally, they struggle with how Rizal’s personal relationships, particularly with Josephine Bracken, were recorded in history. The lack of reliable sources makes it difficult to determine whether they were truly married or if certain events were exaggerated.
    
    <br><br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>At one point, one of the filmmakers sarcastically remarks that making a film about Rizal feels like an endless detective investigation rather than a straightforward historical retelling. This frustration highlights how history is often filled with gaps, leaving room for interpretation (14:03 - 16:03, 45:40 - 47:08).
</p>
<hr style=" margin: 0px 50px; margin-top: 50px;">
<h1 style="margin:20px 100px ;margin-top: 60px; color:#693115; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 90px bold;" >  10. The film concludes with a reflection on Rizal&#39;s legacy. How do the filmmakers interpret his impact
    on contemporary Philippine society?</h1>
<p id="Summary" style="border: #d9a96581 solid 2px; padding: 30px 50px; margin: 0px 90px; color: #693115; background-color: #d9a96581; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px #505050; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 20px;">
    <img src="assets/DeLeon/D10.jpg" style="margin-left: 400px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><img>
    <br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>The film ends with a thought-provoking reflection on Rizal’s impact on Philippine society. Rather than presenting him as an unquestionable hero, it challenges the audience to consider the complexities of his life.

    <br><br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>One character asks whether Rizal would still be considered a hero today, given that he distanced himself from the revolution. The film also explores the idea that Rizal’s heroism has been shaped by those who wrote history, particularly the American colonial government, which officially recognized him as the National Hero while downplaying figures like Andres Bonifacio.
    
    <br><br><span style="visibility: hidden;">-----------</span>Ultimately, the film concludes that Rizal’s influence is undeniable, even if some aspects of his story remain controversial. His writings, ideals, and legacy continue to inspire Filipinos, proving that history is not just about facts—it is about interpretation and meaning (01:26:31 - 01:30:46).
