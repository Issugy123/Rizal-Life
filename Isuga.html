    <p id="Summary" style="border: rgb(255, 255, 255) solid 2px; padding: 50px; margin: 50px; visibility: hidden;;">
        
        <br>The 19th century was a crucial period in Philippine history, bringing major political, economic, social, and cultural changes. Under Spanish colonial rule, the Philippines was governed by the Governor-General, who represented the Spanish Crown. However, the colonial government was highly corrupt, with excessive taxation and widespread abuses by Spanish officials and friars. Liberal ideas from Europe, particularly from the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, influenced José Rizal and other Filipino intellectuals, shaping their desire for reform and justice.

        <br>Economically, Spain’s decision to open Manila to world trade in 1834 led to significant changes. A new middle class, the ilustrados, emerged, including Rizal’s family. While this boosted economic activity through cash crops like sugar, tobacco, and abaca, it also worsened economic inequality. Spanish elites and friars controlled vast lands (haciendas), forcing Filipino farmers into unfair labor systems such as polo y servicios (forced labor). This growing economic disparity fueled resentment among Filipinos.
        
        <br>Education and social structure also played a role in the awakening of Filipino nationalism. The ilustrados studied in Europe and returned with progressive ideas, advocating for reforms. However, the education system remained under the control of Spanish friars, limiting access to knowledge for most Filipinos. The Gomburza execution in 1872 further ignited resistance, as Filipino priests like Father José Burgos fought for equal treatment in the church. Rizal, influenced by these events, strongly supported education and empowerment, including advocating for women’s rights, as seen in his letter to the women of Malolos.
        
        <br>This topic was chosen by this  because it provides a clear understanding of the historical events that shaped Rizal’s thoughts and actions. It highlights how various political, economic, and social issues fueled Filipino nationalism and led to the eventual fight for independence. Learning about Rizal in the context of the 19th century helps in appreciating his role not just as a writer but as a key figure in the country’s fight against colonial oppression. His story remains relevant today, reminding Filipinos of the importance of education, critical thinking, and standing up against injustices.

By 06:32, they delve into the challenge of balancing Rizal's intellectual contributions with his personal life, questioning whether he was truly a revolutionary or just an intellectual who inspired revolution.
